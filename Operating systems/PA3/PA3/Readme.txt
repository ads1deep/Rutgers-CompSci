The program utilizes a lump of the size 1<<20 (1048576 bytes). We split it into two parts. The left part is devoted for lumps littler than 1000 bytes while the correct piece is committed for lumps greater than 1000 bytes. Each mementry contains connections to past and succeeding mementry, a perceiving design introduced to 0xAAAAAAAA, isfree signal showing if the lump is allotted or not, and a size variable demonstrating the extent of the piece. The lallocated and rallocated factors check add up to bytes designated for little pieces and enormous lumps separately. We utilize it to check condition for immersion. In malloc work, we initially introduce the root (indicating beginning of the piece) and last (indicating the finish of the square). The enormous variable checks if the piece to be distributed is a little lump or not. Contingent upon enormous, we cross the piece from root to center or from last to center. Regardless, the pieces are assigned from closures to the center. The perceiving design is utilized to check whether the pointer go to free is pointing at a mementry structure, else free won't work. In the free capacity, we check if the pointer go to be liberated isn't invalid, focuses to a substantial mementry structure and doesn't attempt to free a lump as of now liberated. In the event that that isn't this case, we check the neighbors of the piece. On the off chance that both of the neighbor is free, we join both the pieces. Toward the finish of free, we never leave with at least two free squares.
